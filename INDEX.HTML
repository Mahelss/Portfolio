        <p>
            My name is Ashley Nyandiko Maheli, a final-year Chemistry student at the University of Nairobi. My research led me to explore website and AI tool design, sparking a passion for technology. I received a software engineering scholarship, allowing me to merge my chemistry background with software engineering. Iâ€™m excited about innovating at the intersection of these fields, such as developing computational chemistry tools. My goal is to leverage technology to advance chemical research and contribute my unique skills to a dynamic team on impactful projects.
